    <p>
        Talk about Mexican soul food; you can’t get more quintessential than Pozole! 
        This is a Mesoamerican dish and was an Aztec favorite long before Columbus 
        ever sailed the ocean blue. There are even restaurants specializing in it, 
        called pozolerías!

        It was one of the first real Mexican dishes I fell in love 
        with while living in Puebla, Mexico. Various cooks in Mexico shared their methods with me, and this is my version, created using the ingredients I’m able to find at my local grocery store. Everyone makes it their own bysprinkling on their favorite crunchy, fresh and aromatic toppings before digging into this steamy bowl of yumminess.
